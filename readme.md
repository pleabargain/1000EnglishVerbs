# simple python script to import a csv of EN verbs

If you use the script on another csv remember that spaces in headers are not recommended

# goal
Create python scripts that will generate basic sentences pulling data from the db

# remember 
The goal not the particulars. I thought I could get what I wanted in SQL. I'm sure I can but using Pandas gave me an easy first step. Maybe the wrong first step but here I am with a basic working script.


e.g.
I should have {Past_Participle} something
